# Contributing to Őrmező Parking Dashboard

First off, thank you for considering contributing!

## How Can I Help?
1.  **Reporting Bugs**: Open an issue describing the bug and include steps to reproduce it.
2.  **Adding Facilities**: Suggest new parking lots by providing the URL and CSS selectors.
3.  **UI Improvements**: We aim to keep the layout "frozen" in its current structure, but CSS refinements for readability are welcome.

## Development Process
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the scraper runs successfully locally (`node extractor.js`).
4. Issue a Pull Request.

## Coding Standards
- Use `SF Mono` for data-heavy elements.
- Maintain the Cyberpunk color palette (#ffcc00, #00ffcc, #ff8800).
